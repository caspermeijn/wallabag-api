## Examples

A few small examples are provided. To use these, the following environment
variables must be set (for authentication). For example:

```sh
export WALLABAG_CLIENT_ID="client_id"
export WALLABAG_CLIENT_SECRET="client_secret"
export WALLABAG_USERNAME="username"
export WALLABAG_PASSWORD="password"
export WALLABAG_URL="https://framabag.org" # must not end with trailing slash
```

The examples include:

- [check_exists](examples/check_exists.rs): check if there is an entry
  corresponding to the url provided.
- [example_sandbox](examples/example_sandbox.rs): a bunch of (mostly) commented
  out small examples, used for manual testing... have fun experimenting!
- [get_entries](examples/get_entries.rs): simply retrieve and debug print all
  entries. See the source code for filtering options.
- [get_entries_page](examples/get_entries_page.rs): example fetching a single
  page of entries without auto handling pagination.
- [save_url](examples/save_url.rs): save a url to the server, printing the
  created entry on success.
